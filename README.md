# Huffman Algorithm Implementation

This project is an implementation of the Huffman algorithm, a popular compression technique used in data compression and transmission. The Huffman algorithm is a lossless compression algorithm that generates variable-length codes for characters in a given text or data stream, where frequently occurring characters are assigned shorter codes and less frequent characters are assigned longer codes.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of the Huffman algorithm by providing a practical implementation. The implementation allows users to compress and decompress text files using Huffman coding.

Features
Text file compression: The project provides a function to compress a given text file using Huffman coding.

Text file decompression: The project also includes a function to decompress a previously compressed file.

Command-line interface: The project offers a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the compression and decompression functionality.
